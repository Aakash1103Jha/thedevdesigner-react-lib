# React UI Component Library

A collection of reusable React UI components, by yours truly, thedevdesigner.

Right now, I am coming up with a list of simple components to add in this package.

## Usage

Run `npm i --save thedevdesigner-react-lib` in your project root (that contains the `package.json` file) to get started.

## Example

```javascript
import { Button } from 'thedevdesigner-react-lib

...

<Button label='Click Me' />
```
